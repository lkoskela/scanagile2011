You're inside a Git repository!

Git is a version control system and all the exercise material is stashed into Git branches. In case you're not familiar with Git here's a super-brief tutorial that'll get you through this workshop.

LISTING AVAILABLE BRANCHES:
$  git branch

JUMPING TO A BRANCH:
$  git checkout branch-name-here

EVERYTHING ELSE:
raise your hand and we'll get you going again.
